							<p class="description">The main objective of our project is to develop the village
								economically and culturally by making it a spot of case studies for numerous
								students from India and abroad whose main subject of their studies or interest is the
								culture and social status of villages in India. After visiting the villages personally, we have captured a few images that tell many things about the village. We also find it optimal to make it a host of homestays for the people visiting the village. We can make the village people more aware of the business which is hypocritically meant for the people in cities. We aim to make the village people more independent, especially women and also improve the social status of the village as a whole.

							<p class="description">Social intervention + Improvement . The nature of the
								project involves both the things mentioned above. The plan is to set up a homestay
								business in the village with the villagers themselves being capable of handling it
								without any government intervention. It would basically end up being a NGO or
								self help groups which earn the profits and distribute among themselves. The
								villagers would be trained in this field and then made independent enough to
								handle themselves. Once the villagers start earning the profits they can share
								among themselves which would lead to the improvement of their livelihood and
								social status. The village would get fame and hence attract more visitors which
								would directly impact the revenue

				<h2>Duration of the work</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<div class="education-horizontal-timeline">
					<div class="row">
						<div>
							<p class="description">The duration of the plan to be executed might
								approximately take one to two years. The project plan is described as follows :
								1. We have clicked the pictures of the village which can be of interest to study
								for numerous visitors from India and abroad as well.
								2. The pictures would be advertised on the website that we have created
								specially for the home stays of Gongluru village and also on the instagram
								handles.
								a. Link for the website -
								b. Link for the instagram -
								3. We expect more people to visit the village after this advertisement. This
								would be our gain because the people who visit need places to stay in the
								village for which new homestays would be built in the village which is run
								by the villagers again.
								4. The plan is to educate the villagers enough for them to be capable of
								handling business activities and hence manage the home stays .
								5. We communicated with a few villagers personally which made us realize the
								potential in them . We visited a school in the village which is co-ed and takes
								classes upto 10th standard. The students we talked to are bright and have
								potential to be educated regarding business activities.
								6. The students and teachers we contacted were also capable of handling digital
								devices like phones and computers if taught and also social media like
								facebook and instagram. They can be easily made aware of how to handle
								the website we create and take care of the bookings and site seeing online.
								7. There is a women's self help group in the village which consists of women
								who independently work on producing many things like cold-pressed oils ,
								soaps etc.. These women are pretty bold enough as we realized and hence it
								would be easy to make more women in the village independent with their
								help.
								8. As we talked with the villagers, we also realized that they are more
								hospitable and welcome to all kinds of people. They donâ€™t have any issues or
								problems with people visiting their villages for study. In Fact they were more
								than happy to narrate to us the cultural history of the village , their daily life
								activities and many more. This quality of the villagers would naturally help
								them be successful in the homestay business .
								9. There are few lands owned by the villagers in few areas of the village which
								are calm and moderate for constructing the homestays. If the villagers are
								willing, we can use their lands which are uncultivated and lying
								unproductive to build the homestays and ensure that they get higher profits
								from the benefits for their great contribution.
								10.There are few homes in the village which are constructed half and not
								completed hence none stays . We can improve them and make use of them as
								well for our homestays in agreement with the house owners.
								11.Finally we have to make sure that the income from this is sufficient enough
								to sustain all the villagers working for this project and also little profits to
								improve the villageâ€™s environment. We should try and preserve the culture of
								the village as much as possible while trying to improve the social status of it.

				<h2>Impact of the Project in Villages</h2>

						<div>
							<p class="description">As already mentioned above, the impact
								of the project would be :
								1. Makes villagers literate and educated
								2. Makes them independent enough to take care of themselves and their village
								3. The village would get a bit of fame and would end up being a hub of cultural
								study
								4. The unproductive lands of the village would be turned into a place of stay
								and hence would be efficiently utilized for profits.
								5. The aim is to make the villagers handle the business all by themselves which
								would ultimately lead to more employment opportunities.
								6. The profits from the business would be shared among all the villagers and
								also little would be kept aside for the improvement of the villageâ€™s
								environment.
								7. The cultural heritage of the village would be known to many visitors and
								hence would be preserved better than ever.
								8. The social status of the village would be improved as a whole.
